1. At the home page there is a button named **Get Random Recipe** which renders randomly a recipe from the [recipe api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Get-Random-Recipes). _The rendered recipe number can be increased but due to api call limitation, only one render recipe is rendered._
   ![Get Random Recipe](./readmeSources/get_random_recipe.png)

   - with _Get Random Recipe_ feature, **per recipe title, image, cooking time and serving number** is rendered. Also below every recipe there is a **like** button and **Recipe Details** button. When clicked **like** button, recipe is stored in **favorite recipes** _which can be reached by clicking **Favorite Recipes** link in the navigation section which is at the top of the page_.

     ![Favorite Recipes](./readmeSources/favorite_recipes.png)
     In this page favorite recipes are rendered if there is no any favored recipe, it says ❤️Like Some Recipe❤️.

   - When clicked **Recipe details**, Recipe Details page is opened for that recipe.
     ![Favorite Recipes](./readmeSources/recipe_details.png)
     In this page, recipe details are rendered which are **image, title, preparation time, servings, instructions for preparation**.

1. In the navigation section there is **Plan Your Meals** link. When clicked, a new page is opened **with an input area which is for calories** and a button for **getting daily meal plan according to calories entered** by using [recipe api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Get-Meal-Plan-Day)

1. In the navigation section there is **Find Recipe** link. When clicked, a new page is opened **with an input area which is for name, ingredients etc related to a recipe** and a button for **Searching Recipe**. _Due to api call limit only one result is rendered_ by [recipe api] (https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-Complex)
